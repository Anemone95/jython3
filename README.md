Jython: Python for the Java Platform

Welcome to Jython 3.5!

This repo is in the very early stages of development of a release of
Jython 3.5. Planned goals are language and runtime compatibility with
CPython 3.5, along with continued substantial support of the Python
ecosystem.

Please see ACKNOWLEDGMENTS for details about Jython's copyright,
license, contributors, and mailing lists; and NEWS for detailed
release notes, including bugs fixed, backwards breaking changes, and
new features.
